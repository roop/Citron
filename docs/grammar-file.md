## Grammar

### Symbols

A grammar for a language or format is composed of production rules. The
rules make use of [terminal and non-terminal symbols][term-non-term].
In a Citron grammar, both terminals and non-terminals should be named
using alphabets, digits and underscores only. Terminals should start
with an uppercase letter and non-terminals should start with a lowercase
letter. Typically, terminal names are CamelCased and non-terminal
names are lowercased.

Some parser generators ([Bison][bison_literal_token] for example) allow
literal characters and strings to be directly used in a grammar rule,
but Citron does not. In Citron, all terminals should be named.

We also call terminals as tokens. Citron directives
use the term "token" to denote a terminal symbol.

[term-non-term]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_and_nonterminal_symbols
[cfg]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar

### Rules

Citron can work with only [context-free grammars][cfg], where there must
be exactly one non-terminal symbol on the left hand side (LHS) of the
rule, and zero or more terminal or non-terminal symbols on the right
hand side (RHS) of the rule.

[bison_literal_token]: https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/html_node/Symbols.html

An arrow string ("::=") should be used as the separator between the LHS
and the RHS of a rule.  A period (".") should be used to mark the end of
the rule. The rule can be completely in one line, or can be broken up
into multiple lines, but either way, it has to end with a period.

The RHS of a rule should contain only terminal or non-terminal symbols,
so we cannot specify alternativity (either this sequence of symbols or
this other sequence of symbols) or optionality (this symbol may or may
not come here) directly in a rule. Rather, we should break that out
into separate rules.

### An example

Consider the following grammar for a Swift function header
(the part before the body of a function), a simplified version of [the
function declaration grammar][func_decl] from the [Swift Language Reference]:

> _function-header_ → <code><b>func</b></code> _function-name function-signature_<br/>
> _function-name_ → _identifier_<br/>
>
> _function-signature_ → _parameter-clause_ <code><b>throws</b></code>_<sub>opt</sub> function-result<sub>opt</sub>_<br/>
> _function-signature_ → _parameter-clause_ <code><b>rethrows</b></code> _function-result<sub>opt</sub>_<br/>
> _function-result_ → <code><b>-></b></code> _type_<br/>
>
> _parameter-clause_ → <code><b>(</b></code> <code><b>)</b></code> | <code><b>(</b></code> _parameter-list_ <code><b>)</b></code><br/>
> _parameter-list_ → _parameter_ | _parameter_ <code><b>,</b></code> _parameter-list_<br/>
> _parameter_ → _external-parameter-name<sub>opt</sub> local-parameter-name type-annotation_<br/>
> _external-parameter-name_ → _identifier_<br/>
> _local-parameter-name_ → _identifier_<br/>
>
> _type-annotation_ → <code><b>:</b></code> <code><b>inout</b></code><sub>opt</sub> _type_<br/>
> _type_ → _identifier_<br/>

[func_decl]: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Declarations.html#//apple_ref/swift/grammar/function-declaration
[Swift Language Reference]: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/AboutTheLanguageReference.html

The literal words (like <code><b>func</b></code> and
<code><b>inout</b></code>, etc.) and punctuation (like
<code><b>(</b></code> and <code><b>)</b></code>) in the grammar are
tokens that should get recognized in the previous tokenization stage. We
should also recognize identifiers during tokenization. The other symbols
should be treated as non-terminals.

We can rewrite the above grammar as an input for Citron as follows:

~~~ Text
func_header ::= Func func_name func_signature.
func_name ::= Identifier.

func_signature ::= param_clause.
func_signature ::= param_clause func_result.
func_signature ::= param_clause throws_clause func_result.
func_signature ::= param_clause throws_clause.
throws_clause ::= Throws.
throws_clause ::= Rethrows.
func_result ::= Arrow type.

param_clause ::= OpenParen CloseParen.
param_clause ::= OpenParen param_list CloseParen.
param_list ::= param.
param_list ::= param Comma param_list.
param ::= local_param_name type_annotation.
param ::= external_param_name local_param_name type_annotation.

external_param_name ::= Identifier.
local_param_name ::= Identifier.

type_annotation ::= Colon type.
type_annotation ::= Colon Inout type.
type ::= Identifier.
~~~

Alternatives are handled by creating a separate rule for each
alternative (see rules for `param_clause` and `param_list`).

Optional symbols in a rule are handled by breaking the rule into two
rules, one excluding the symbol and one including it (see rules for `param` and
`type_annotation`). If there are multiple optional symbols, we have to
create rules for each combination of possible symbols (see rules for
`func_signature`).

Now we have a complete grammar that Citron can understand.
We can save this grammar into a grammar file, say
`grammar.y` and [run citron][run] on the grammar file.

~~~
$ clang Sources/citron/main.c -o ./citron
$ ./citron grammar.y
~~~

At this point, running citron on the grammar file will only check for
any grammar-related errors like conflicts and unreachable rules, but
will not generate a parser.

[run]: ../generating-the-parser/#running-citron

To be able to generate a parser, we also need to declare the types for
the grammar's symbols and provide code blocks for our grammar's rules.

## Types

Citron requires that we specify the **semantic type** of each symbol
used in the grammar. That's the type we use to represent that symbol in
our code.

A **semantic value** of a symbol is a value of the semantic type of the
symbol. That's the value of that symbol in our code.

### Types for terminals

All terminal symbols are assumed to have the same semantic type.

For example, we could represent the terminals in the [above
grammar](#an-example) with an enumeration like this:

~~~ Swift
enum Token {
    case keyword // for Func, Throws, Inout, etc.
    case punctuation // for (, ), ->, etc.
    case identifier(String) // for Identifier
}
~~~

We can specify that the semantic type for all terminals is the `Token`
enumeration by using the [%token_type](#token_type) directive in the
grammar file, like this:

~~~ Text
%token_type Token
~~~

### Types for non-terminals

Different non-terminal symbols can have different semantic types.

We can specify the type of each non-terminal using the
[%nonterminal_type](#nonterminal_type) directive.

It can be hard to come up with the semantic types for all the
non-terminals in the grammar at one go, so Citron also lets us specify a
semantic type to be used for all non-terminals in the grammar using the
[%default_nonterminal_type](#default_nonterminal_type) directive.

~~~ Text
%default_nonterminal_type Void
~~~

<span id="struct-functionparameter">Consider the non-terminal `param` in the
[above grammar](#an-example) -- it represents a function
paramater.</span> We could represent that in our code with a struct
defined like this:

~~~ Swift
struct FunctionParameter {
    let localName: String
    let externalName: String?
    let type: String
    let isInout: Bool
}
~~~

We can specify that the semantic type for the non-terminal `param` is
`FunctionParameter` by using the [%nonterminal_type](#nonterminal_type)
directive in the grammar file, like this:

~~~ Text
%nonterminal_type param FunctionParameter
~~~

We can use arrays and tuples to build intermediate types. For example,
the non-terminal `type_annotation` can be represented by a tuple, like
this:

~~~ Text
%nonterminal_type type_annotation "(type: String, isInout: Bool)"
~~~

The sematic type for all terminals, and the semantic type for each
non-terminal should be specified in the Citron grammar file.

It's a good practice to keep the type specifications of non-terminals
closer to the rules that use these non-terminals, so that the code blocks
for the rules are easier to read.

We can place the type definitions anywhere in our project, and should
just make it available when compiling the generated parser code, either
by including it in the same module, or by importing the defining module.

## Code blocks

Citron requires that each grammar rule be followed by a code block
associated with that rule. The code block is invoked every time that
rule is used during parsing.

Conceptually, the code block for a rule takes [semantic values] of its
RHS symbols as input and returns a [semantic value] of its LHS symbol
as output.

[semantic value]: #types
[semantic values]: #types
[semantic type]: #types
[semantic types]: #types

Consider the following rule:

~~~ Text
param ::= local_param_name type_annotation.
~~~

The code block for this rule should take the local parameter name and
the type annotation as inputs, and should return the function
parameter.

We can choose which inputs we want to work with and by what name by
adding aliases to the required symbols. For example, we could modify the
rule as:

~~~ Text
param ::= local_param_name(lpn) type_annotation(ta).
~~~

Then we'd be able to access `lpn` and `ta` inside the code block for
this rule. The type of `lpn` would be the [semantic type] specified for
`local_param_name` (let's assume that's `String`). The type of `ta`
would be `(type: String, isInout: Bool)`, which is the [semantic type] we
declared for `type_annotation`. The code block should return a value of
type `FunctionParameter`, which is the [semantic type] we declared for
`param`.

We can write a code block for this rule as follows:

~~~ Text
param ::= local_param_name(lpn) type_annotation(ta). {
    return FunctionParameter(localName: lpn,
            externalName: nil, type: ta.type, isInout: ta.isInout)
}
~~~

Likewise, we should write a code block for each rule in our grammar.

Each code block becomes the body of a member function in the generated
parser class. The above code block would look something like this in the
generated code:

~~~ Swift
func codeBlockForRule13(lpn: String, ta: (type: String, isInout: Bool)) throws -> FunctionParameter {
    return FunctionParameter(localName: lpn,
            externalName: nil, type: ta.type, isInout: ta.isInout)
}
~~~

Since the code block is placed in a function with stricty typed
parameters, any type mismatches would show up as compile-time errors.

The code block may throw run-time errors and these errors will be
propagated up to one of the parsing methods: [`consume(token:, code:)`],
or [`endParsing()`]. This can be used to handle semantic errors from
within code blocks. For example, if we have an arithmetic expression
evaluator that evaluates an expression as it parses it, we might want to
throw on a division-by-zero error.

[`consume(token:, code:)`]: /citron/parsing-interface/api/CitronParser/#consumetoken-citrontoken-tokencode-citrontokencode
[`endParsing()`]: /citron/parsing-interface/api/CitronParser/#endparsing

The code blocks are a great way to build a data structure (usually a
parse tree) representing the parsed data. Typically, the code block for
a rule builds the data structure representing the LHS symbol of the
rule. This data structure will eventually get passed as input to a code
block of a rule that uses this rule's LHS symbol in the RHS, and thereby
get incorporated into a higher level data structure (in case of a
parse-tree, a higher level node i.e. a node closer to the root of the
tree). Finally, the [start rule](#start-rule)'s code block shall return the
complete data structure representing the whole input data.

Once we have the grammar rules, type specifications and code blocks, we
can ask Citron to [generate a parser](/citron/generating-the-parser/)
for us.

It can be hard to come up with the correct code block for all the rules
at one go, so Citron lets us define a default code block to be used for
a given LHS symbol. While defining the semantic type of a non-terminal
with the [%nonterminal_type](#nonterminal_type) directive, we can also
specify a default code block. If a rule's LHS is this non-terminal and
the rule doesn't have a code block specified, the default code block
will be used.

We can also specify a default code block in the
[%default_nonterminal_type](#default_nonterminal_type) directive, which
would make Citron pick up that code block whenever a rule's LHS symbol's
semantic type was inferred using the
[%default_nonterminal_type](#default_nonterminal_type) directive, and
the rule doesn't have a code block specified.

## Directives

### Type specification

Citron requires that the [semantic types](#types) of all symbols used in
the grammar be declared in the grammar file using these directives:

#### token_type

Specifies the [semantic type](#types) for all terminals. If the type is a
compound type with use of special characters, it should be enclosed in
"quotes" or {brackets}.

Example:

~~~ Text
%token_type String
~~~

#### nonterminal_type

Specifies the [semantic type](#types) for a particular non-terminal. If
the type is a compound type, it should be enclosed in "quotes" or
{brackets}.

Example:

~~~ Text
%nonterminal_type type_annotation "(type: String, isInout: Bool)"
~~~

Optionally, we can specify a default code block to be used for all rules
with this non-terminal as the LHS.

~~~ Text
%nonterminal_type type_annotation "(type: String, isInout: Bool)" {
    return (type: "", isInout: false)
}
~~~

#### default_nonterminal_type

Specifies the [semantic type](#types) for all non-terminals that don't
have types specified with [%nonterminal_type](#nonterminal_type). If the
type is a compound type, it should be enclosed in "quotes" or
{brackets}.

Example:

~~~ Text
%default_nonterminal_type String
~~~

Optionally, we can specify a default code block to be used for all rules
whose LHS symbol's semantic type was inferred using this directive.

~~~ Text
%default_nonterminal_type String { return "" }
~~~

### Naming

#### class_name

Specifies the name of the parser class generated by Citron. If this
directive is not present, the class is named `Parser`.

Example:

~~~ Text
%class_name ConfigFileParser
~~~

#### tokencode_prefix

By default, the token code enum values are the same as the token names
used in the grammar. For example, the above grammar uses the token names
`Func` and `Identifier`, so the token code enum will include the values
`.Func` and `.Identifier`.

Specifying a token code prefix directive will cause the enum values to be
generated with the specified prefix.

For example, to make the enum values Swiftier, we can say:

~~~ Text
%tokencode_prefix token
~~~

This will cause the enum to be generated with values `.tokenFunc` and
`.tokenIdentifier`.

#### nonterminalcode_prefix

Specifying a non-terminal code prefix directive will cause the enum
values for non-terminals to be generated with the specified prefix.

This is not normally used, and exists only as a counterpart to
[%tokencode_prefix](#tokencode_prefix).

~~~ Text
%nonterminalcode_prefix nt_
~~~

### Code insertion

#### preface

Specifying a preface will include the contents of the preface _before_
the parser class in the output file. This can be used to import modules
or define types that are required for the code in the code blocks.

Example:

~~~ Text
%preface {
    import Foundation
}
~~~

#### epilogue

Specifying an epilogue will include the contents of the preface _after_
the parser class in the output file. One use for this would be to extend
the parser class to add additional functionality.

Example:

~~~ Text
%epilogue {
    extension Parser: MyProtocol {
        func conformingFunction() {
            doSomething()
        }
    }
}
~~~

#### extra_class_members

Using this directive, we can add extra class members to the parser
class. Since code blocks are also member functions, any extra members we
add become accessible from inside the code blocks. This is a great way
to make the parser configurable.

For example, if we specify %extra_class_members like this:

~~~ Text
%extra_class_members {
    let shouldGenerateParseTree: Bool
    init(shouldGenerateParseTree: Bool) {
        self.shouldGenerateParseTree = shouldGenerateParseTree
    }
}
~~~

We can access the `shouldGenerateParseTree` as an instance variable
in all our code blocks. The code blocks can then conditionally
generate the parse tree. Creating the parser as
`Parser(shouldGenerateParseTree: false)` would suspend parse tree
generation.

### Precedence and associativity

A grammar rule with multiple recursions can cause the grammar to become
ambiguous, resulting in shift-reduce conflicts. One way to fix these
conflicts is to specify associativity. When there are multiple such
rules, we might also need to specify the relative precedence between
them.

For example:

~~~ Text
%left_associative Plus Minus.
%left_associative Mult Div.
%right_associative Pow.
~~~

specifies that:

  - The tokens `Plus` and `Minus` are left associative and equal in
    precedence compared to each other
  - The tokens `Mult` and `Div` are left associative and equal in
    precedence compared to each other
  - The token `Pow` is right associative
  - The token `Pow` has higher precedence than the tokens `Mult` and
    `Div`
  - The tokens `Mult` and `Div` have higher precedence than the tokens
    `Plus` and `Minus`

Citron handles precedence and associativity in the same way as Lemon, so
the "Precedence Rules" section in the [Lemon documentation][lemon_doc]
applies to Citron as well. Lemon's %left, %right and %nonassoc
correspond to Citron's %left_associative, %right_associative and
%nonassociative respectively.

[lemon_doc]: https://www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/lemon.html

#### left_associative

Gives a list of tokens, specifying that these tokens should be
considered left associative.

For example:

~~~ Text
%left_associative Plus Minus.
~~~

The `%left_associative` directive should end with a `.` character.

#### right_associative

Gives a list of tokens, specifying that these tokens should be
considered right associative.

For example:

~~~ Text
%right_associative Pow.
~~~

The `%right_associative` directive should end with a `.` character.

#### nonassociative

Gives a list of tokens, specifying that these tokens should be
considered non associative.

For example:

~~~ Text
%nonassociative EqualTo LessThan GreaterThan.
~~~

The `%nonassociative` directive should end with a `.` character.

### Grammar controls

#### start_symbol

Specifies the nonterminal to be used as the start symbol of the grammar.

If this directive is not specified, the LHS of the first rule in the
grammar is considered to be start symbol.

For example:

~~~ Text
%start_symbol func_header
~~~

<span id="start-rule">There can be only one rule in the grammar with the
start symbol as the LHS -- that rule is called the **start rule** of the
grammar.</span>

#### token

The order of tokens in the `CitronTokenCode` enumeration is determined
by the order in which the tokens appear in the grammar. In case we want
a token to appear earlier in the enumeration, we can tell Citron about
the token before it appears in the grammar with this directive.

For example:

~~~ Text
%token COMMA
~~~

#### fallback

Specifies that a token can, if required, be treated as another token.

For example, in the above grammar, the keywords `throws` and `rethrows`
would be identified as the tokens `Throws` and `Rethrows`. So an input
like `func fn(throws: Bool)` would result in a syntax error, because the
`Throws` token is not allowed inside the parameters clause. In case we
want to allow the use of `throws` and `rethrows` as identifiers, we can
say:

~~~ Text
%fallback Identifier Throws Rethrows.
~~~

This specifies that the tokens `Throws` and `Rethrows` can be treated
as `Identifier` if that would help avoid a syntax error.

The `%fallback` directive should end with a `.` character.

#### wildcard

Specifies a catch-all [fallback](#fallback) token.

For example:

~~~ Text
%wildcard Identifier.
~~~

specifies that `Identifier` is a fallback for _every other_ token in the
grammar.

The `%wildcard` directive should end with a `.` character.

#### token_set

Specifies that a nonterminal should be treated as a set of tokens.

For example, in the above grammar, the `throws_clause` nonterminal might
get defined like this, along with type specifications and code
blocks:

~~~ Text
%nonterminal_type throws_clause FunctionToken // same as %token_type

throws_clause ::= Throws(t). { return t }
throws_clause ::= Rethrows(t). { return t }
~~~

We can replace all those lines with a token set specification like
this:

~~~ Text
%token_set throws_clause Throws | Rethrows.
~~~

The `%token_set` directive should end with a `.` character.

### Error capturing

#### capture_errors

Used to enable error capturing for a particular nonterminal.

Also used to specify the synchronization tokens for that nonterminal. In
case a parse error occurred while this particular nonterminal was
getting parsed, the synchronization tokens given here will be used to
figure out where this nonterminal ends.

Synchronization tokens are specified using _end\_before_ and
_end\_after_ clauses.

An _end\_before clause_ is the keyword `end_before` followed by a list
of tokens, separated by either `,` or `|`, enclosed in parantheses. For
example, the clause `end_before(Comma | CloseBracket)` specifies that
the nonterminal should be considered to end just before the next `Comma`
or `CloseBracket` token.

An _end\_after clause_ is similar, but with the `end_after` keyword.
For example, the clause `end_after(Throws | Rethrows)` specifies that
the nonterminal should be considered to end just after the next `Throws`
or `Rethrows` token.

In an _end\_after clause_, we can also have a sequence of tokens,
enclosed in square brackets. For example, the clause
`end_after([CloseBracket Throws] | [CloseBracket Rethrows])` specifies
that the nonterminal should be considered to end just after the next
`Throws` or `Rethrows` token, only if that token is preceded by a
`CloseBracket` token.

Both the `end_before` and `end_after` clauses are optional. If any of
the tokens (or token sequences) in any of the clauses matches, the
nonterminal would be considered to end. Additionally, the nonterminal
would be considered to end when the end of input is reached (i.e. when
[`endParsing()`] is called).

[`endParsing()`]: /citron/parsing-interface/api/CitronParser/#endparsing

Here's an example of a complete `%capture_errors` directive:

~~~ Text
%capture_errors param
    end_before(Comma | CloseBracket)
    end_after([Colon, Identifier] | [KeywordInout, Identifier]).
~~~

<span id="grammar-ending-non-terminal">In case of **grammar-ending
non-terminals**, where the end of the non-terminal signifies the end of
the grammar (for example, the [start symbol]), the typical usage is to
specify neither an `end_before` nor an `end_after` clause.

[start symbol]: #start_symbol

For example, to capture errors on the start symbol, `func_header`, we
say:

~~~ Text
%capture_errors func_header.
~~~

This means that if an error occurred while the non-terminal
`func_header` was being parsed, the non-terminal should be considered to
end only when the end of input is reached (i.e. when
[`endParsing()`] is called).

The `%capture_errors` directive should end with a `.` character.
